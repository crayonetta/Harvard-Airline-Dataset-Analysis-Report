# Harvard-Airline-Dataset-Analysis-Report
The Harvard Airline On Time dataset entails a large dataset with many years to pick from. Please access it here: doi/10.7910/DVN/HG7NV7. In this project, analysis was completed in both Python and R to answer key business concerns. 
In this project, Linear regression, decision trees and random forest was used to forecast flight delays. 
Visualisations were created for reporting and answering the following questions: 
1. When is the best time of the day, day of the week, and time of the year to fly to minimise delays?
2. Do older planes suffer more delays?
3. How does the number of people flying between different locations change over time?
4. Detect if cascading failures as delays in one airport and create delays in others?
5. Construct a model that predicts flight delays
